  A CCTDI (California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory)
  automated assessment system based on a four-agent collaboration
  architecture. The core innovation is transforming the traditional
  70-question questionnaire assessment into an intelligent natural
  conversation assessment through AI-driven multi-agent collaboration,
  achieving more humanized and contextualized critical thinking
  ability assessment.
